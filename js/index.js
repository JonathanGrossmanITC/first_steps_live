// Once something is saved in memory, you can interact with it in your JavaScript code
// You can save any data type to a variable
// Once something is saved as a variable, the variable represents that thing in memory, which means the variable can do the things that the underlying data is capable of
// -- For instance, a number stored in a variable: you can add, subtract, multiply, divide and more using the variable
// -- Another is example is a string stored in a variable: you can use that variable to set the text of an HTML element
